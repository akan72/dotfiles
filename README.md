Dotfiles
==============================

My dotfiles! Based upon this [guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) from Atlassian.

## Description

For my development setup, I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my text editor, [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html)
as a terminal replacement (with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) as my shell.
I'm also a fan of [Nerd-Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) and am currently using [Hack](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hack).
For my plugin manager I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

This is a fairly minimalistic approach to tracking dotfiles, and enables easy reproduction on other machines.
